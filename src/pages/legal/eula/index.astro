8. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
================================================================================

8.1 COMMUNITY EDITION. THE COMMUNITY EDITION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
"AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. THE SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN
BUGS OR ERRORS.

8.2 PAID EDITIONS. For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of

in accordance with the Documentation. This warranty does not apply to:
(a) free features or Community Edition functionality; (b) third-party

unauthorized modification, misuse, or third-party software; or (e)
any features designated as "Beta," "Preview," "Evaluation," or "Trial."

8.3 AI AND ANALYSIS DISCLAIMER. The Software utilizes probabilistic
algorithms and Artificial Intelligence ("AI") to identify potential
vulnerabilities. You acknowledge that:

  (a) AI outputs are probabilistic and may produce "hallucinations,"
      false positives, or false negatives;

  (b) The Software may fail to detect existing vulnerabilities (false
      negatives) or report vulnerabilities that do not exist (false
      positives);

  (c) The Software is a tool to assist human analysis, not a substitute
      for it. You remain solely responsible for verifying all findings;

  (d) DonjonSec shall not be liable for any security breach, data loss,
      or compromise occurring in systems scanned by the Software,
      regardless of whether the Software failed to detect the
      vulnerability exploited in such breach.

8.4 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. DonjonSec's entire liability and Your exclusive
remedy for breach of the warranty in Section 8.2 shall be, at
DonjonSec's option, (a) repair or replacement of the Software, or

  MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.

14.1 GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS
ACTION WAIVER.

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING
YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida,
United States, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

(a) MANDATORY ARBITRATION. Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, the Software, or the breach,
termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including
the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to
arbitrate, shall be determined by binding arbitration in Orange County,
Florida before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by
the American Arbitration Association (AAA) pursuant to its Commercial
Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction. THE PARTIES EXPLICITLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A
JURY TRIAL.

(b) CLASS ACTION WAIVER. YOU AND DONJONSEC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING. Further, unless both You and DonjonSec agree otherwise, the
arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with Your
claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative
or class proceeding. If this specific Class Action Waiver is found to
be unenforceable, then the Mandatory Arbitration provision (Section
14.1a) shall be null and void, and the dispute shall be decided by a
court of competent jurisdiction in Seminole County, Florida; however,
the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in force.

(c) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Notwithstanding the foregoing, DonjonSec reserves
the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of
competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
misappropriation, or violation of its copyrights, trademarks, trade
secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. DONJONSEC SHALL
NOT BE REQUIRED TO POST A BOND OR OTHER SECURITY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN
SUCH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

(d) RIGHT TO OPT OUT. You have the right to opt out of the arbitration
agreement and class action waiver in this Section 14.1 within thirty
(30) days of the date You first accepted this Agreement. To exercise
this right, You must send written notice to legal@donjonsec.com with
the subject line "Arbitration Opt-Out." If You opt out, the arbitration
and class action waiver provisions will not apply, and disputes will be
resolved in the state or federal courts located in Seminole County, Florida.

14.2 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties regarding the Software and supersedes all prior
agreements, representations, and understandings.

14.3 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held
unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force
and effect.

14.4 WAIVER. The failure of either party to enforce any right or
provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right
or provision.

14.5 ASSIGNMENT. You may not assign this Agreement without DonjonSec's
prior written consent. DonjonSec may assign, transfer, or delegate this
Agreement and its rights and obligations without Your consent and
without notice in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate
reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets.

14.6 NOTICES. All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and
sent to:

  DonjonSec
  Email: legal@donjonsec.com
  or at such physical address as DonjonSec may designate on its website.

14.7 FORCE MAJEURE. Neither party shall be liable for delays or failures
in performance resulting from causes beyond its reasonable control,
including natural disasters, war, terrorism, pandemics, government
actions, or internet disruptions. The affected party's obligations will
be suspended for the duration of the force majeure event. If such event
continues for more than ninety (90) days, either party may terminate
the affected Subscription Term with a pro-rata refund of prepaid fees.

14.8 UPDATES. DonjonSec may update this Agreement from time to time.
Continued use of the Software after notification of changes (via email,
in-app notification, or website publication at https://donjonsec.com/legal/eula)
constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. Material changes reducing
Your rights or increasing Your obligations will not apply to Paid
Editions until the next Subscription Term renewal.

14.9 ATTORNEYS' FEES. In any legal action, arbitration, or other proceeding
brought to enforce, interpret, or construe the terms of this Agreement,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs from the non-prevailing party.
